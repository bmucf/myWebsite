          <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
          <p>My name is Brian Mosquera and at the time of writing this I am an undergraduate student at UCF. I am majoring in Digital Media with a focus on Game Design.
            <br>
            <br>
            I graduated from Freedom High School in May of 2016, and the following August I enrolled in Valencia College. Adjusting to adulthood was a struggle for me to say the least, resulting in several years of wasted time and money pursuing an as of yet unknown goal. One day I woke up and realized I wanted to tell stories. I got my act together and fulfilled my graduation requirements for Valencia in the spring of 2022. Following a whirlwind of meetings, applications, and paperwork, I was accepted into UCF that summer.
            <br>
            <br>
            By the time I graduate, I hope to have become a jack of all trades within the digital media industry. My end goal is to be able to independently support myself while telling the stories I want to tell through various media such as comics, videos, and games.

          <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
          <p>I plan to use this website as a portfolio to present all of my projects, artistic or otherwise. </p>
          <p>The type of work I end up doing will vary. In the future I plan to develop my ideas and realize them into either video games, videos, or some other artistic medium. </p>
