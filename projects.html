                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>Many of my projects are inspired by my favorite games, books, and tv shows growing up and today. 
                  <br>
                  Each project will have its own dedicated page for tracking progress, and more projects will be added as I make them.</p>
                <h3>Qualia</h3>
                <p>In philosophy, qualia are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.
                  <br>
                  Qualia will be an evolution game that aims to have a level of customization so deep, the player will truly feel as though they are experiencing the galaxy in a way only they can.
                </p>
                <h3>Imperium (working title)</h3>
                <p>Imperium will be a monster-taming game in which the player directs a team of "Imps" in strategic, grid-based battles.</p>
                <h3>Unnamed Science Fiction Project</h3>
                <p>This is simultaneously my most and least developed project. I have built up some of the setting, but I don't know how to best present it. This is a character-driven story taking place in the future. Many of the characters are strange forms of life, with radically different biocultural identities and evolutionary trends cultivated by environments that differ greatly from those found on Earth.</p>

                    <p>I will post artwork that I am proud of here. Each group will link to a gallery of artwork that fits the theme </p>
